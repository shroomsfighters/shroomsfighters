Long long ago, in a far-away magical forest, there lived Magical Mushrooms that spent all of their time growing $SHROOMs & stacking them. 

The $SHROOM was the main currency with which they could exchange equipment, food, but also have a vote on the decisions of the village!

There lived another tribe of mushrooms in a far-off land, a land of darkness, filled with bad magic.

This tribe coveted the ability to make $SHROOMs that the Magical mushrooms had, as they couldn't do it.

And so, one day, the Dark Mushrooms from the far-off land invaded the magical forest. They plundered and destroyed the entire forest, stealing the $SHROOMs that gave the forest its magic

The different factions managed to agree on one point, only one tribe would have the right to access the reserves of $SHROOM. Thus was born the ELROND SHROOMS FIGHTERS tournament
